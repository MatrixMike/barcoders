try using geany -
build commands herein allow successful build and execution 
maybe I was surprised at what was generated ... looking for an image file

or use : cargo build < in home directory >

so RTFM : exec the cargo command for 'Full Suite'
my barcode read should read these when printed - but not from the screen ...
